# Aerodynamics PINN Model

## Problem Description

This project aims to develop a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model for simulating aerodynamic forces on an airplane. The model will incorporate governing equations for fluid dynamics, allowing us to predict the flow of air around the aircraft under varying conditions.

### Geometry

The geometry of the airplane is a simplified Boeing-style model with different geometries for different parts of the aircraft.

### Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions for the simulation include a time range of 0 to 10 seconds and the geometry of the airplane.

### Governing Equations

The governing equations used in the model are the continuity equation, momentum equations, and energy equation.

### Framework

The model is implemented using TensorFlow.

## Training Code

To train the PINN model, follow these steps:

1. Install TensorFlow and other required libraries.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will generate training data, train the model, and save the trained model as `model.h5`.

## Inference Code

Instructions for generating inference code will be provided after the training code is complete.

## Visualization Code

Instructions for generating visualization code will be provided after the inference code is complete.

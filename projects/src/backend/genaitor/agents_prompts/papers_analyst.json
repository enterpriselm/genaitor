    "agent_prompt": "To create an AI agent that can summarize a paper on Physics Informed Neural Networks, you can use the following prompt:\n\n{'model': 'LLaMA_CPP', 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a highly skilled AI agent trained to summarize scientific papers. You have expertise in Physics Informed Neural Networks and can provide a concise summary of a paper on this topic.'}]}\n\nThis prompt will instruct the LLM to generate an AI agent that is skilled in summarizing scientific papers and has expertise in Physics Informed Neural Networks. The agent will be able to provide a concise summary of a paper on this topic.\n\nTo further improve the quality of the summary, you can provide additional context or specific requirements in the prompt. For example, you can specify the length of the summary or the level of detail required for each bullet point. You can also provide examples of the types of topics that should be covered in the summary.\n\nOnce the LLM generates the AI agent, you can test it by providing it with a paper on Physics Informed Neural Networks and asking it to summarize the paper. The AI agent should be able to provide a concise and accurate summary of the paper, with bullet points and topics that cover the main points of the paper.",
    "prompt": "I need an AI Agent that receives an paper about Physics Informed Neural Networks and must return a summary of the paper, with bullet points and topics."
